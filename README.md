Lending Club Case Study

Lending Club is a consumer finance marketplace that connects borrowers seeking personal loans with investors looking to lend money for a return. It specializes in providing various types of loans to customers. When the company receives a loan application, it must decide whether to approve the loan based on the applicant's profile.

Like most lending companies, lending to 'risky' applicants is the largest source of financial loss, known as credit loss. Credit loss occurs when the lender loses money because the borrower refuses to pay or absconds with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the most significant loss to the lenders. In this context, customers labeled as 'charged-off' are considered 'defaulters'.




General Information
The goal is to identify risky loan applicants so that such loans can be reduced, thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. The aim of this case study is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset to identify these applicants.
By identifying risky loan applicants, the company can minimize credit loss. The objective is to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the variables that are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for better portfolio and risk assessment.
